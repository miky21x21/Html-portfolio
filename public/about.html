<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hereâ€™s a tale of an engineering graduate who decided to dive into the world of web development. Why? Maybe they love the thrill of seeing a semicolon bring their whole project crashing down. Or perhaps they enjoy talking to rubber ducks. Weâ€™ll never know!</p>

<p>He already had a taste of the corporate jungle, having worked as a process executive and a marketing intern. But hey, who doesnâ€™t love a good pivot table or a well-crafted email blast?</p>

<p>But when the day does dim, our friend strums on a whim, Trading code for chords, on a musical hymn. With a guitar in their grip, and a song on their lip, They make the heart skip, as melodies flip</p>

<p>So hereâ€™s to our coding virtuoso with a penchant for melodies. May your code be as harmonious as your music, and may you never encounter an unexpected token in your journey. Keep strumming those strings, both on your guitar and in your code! ðŸŽ¸ðŸ’»</p>
